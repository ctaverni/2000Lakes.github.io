When you live in Switzerland, you inevitably live surrounded by mountains. In the north, the Jura covers 11% of the territory, while the Alps occupy 58% in the south. We can only be fascinated by the beauty and immensity of nature available to us.

But when you take a closer look, what you find there is even more fascinating. What interests us today are the lakes that have developed at more than 800 meters above sea level. Throughout Switzerland, there are more than 1500, of all sizes, all altitudes, all biological and chemical properties.

But what all these lakes have in common is their role as sentinels of global warming. These ecosystems, due to their location, are very vulnerable to the changes that are already very present in these environments.
The increase in average temperatures has cascading consequences:

For these and many other reasons, Swiss high lakes are extremely vulnerable to climate change. They therefore make the resident population of Switzerland, perhaps you, a privileged witness of the consequences of global warming on the environment.

You, your family, your entourage, therefore surely have in your possession information on these lakes. Without knowing it, you can contribute to the elaboration of the web that forms the history of these lakes, and in particular knowledge about the impact of climate change.

And it may already be the case.

Through data analysis, we will seek to answer the following questions:
- How does the Swiss population already share the history of lakes?
- How does this contribute to the collection and sharing of information on climate change?
- How can they continue participating in this history and information sharing?
