Let us now analyze the data that we were able to collect.

We can thus first look at the distribution of the lakes represented in the photographs in the cantons.

In Switzerland, Alpine lakes are mainly located in 4 cantons.

Valais, Ticino and the cantons of Graub√ºnden and Bern account for 79% of the 287 studied lakes. This distribution can easily be explained by two factors. The first is the area of these cantons. Indeed, these are four of the five largest cantons in Switzerland, and they cover 46.6% of the Swiss territory. The second factor is their location. They are all completely or partly located on the Alps mountain range.

17 of the 26 Swiss cantons contain high-altitude lakes, but only 9 are represented by the photographs collected on the rts site. This is explained by the fact that notrehistoire.ch is a French-speaking site. We note that the most present cantons are completely or partially French-speaking: the canton of Vaud, Valais and Fribourg. Moreover, all the images collected have a description - when there is one - written in French except one. This project will therefore mainly focus on the habits of the French-speaking Swiss population and their relationship with high-altitude lakes. Through the studied site, this leaves aside the Germanic and Italian parts of Switzerland.

Another interesting data is the distribution of photographs over time. In addition to those without dates, we note that the images date largely from the period stretching from the year 2000 to the present day, and mainly from the 2010 decade. It is in the latter that smartphone ownership has become the majority . In France, where we can assume that the figures on this subject are more or less equivalent to those of Switzerland, 17% of the population over the age of 12 had a smartphone in 2011. This figure rose to 84% in 2020. This device allows you to take photos at any time and in any place without having planned it. The fact that more images have been posted date from this period is therefore logical.
When we go back further in time, the oldest photo dates from the 1880s. Photography was not yet widespread among individuals. In addition, those that were made were in paper format. For them to be present on notrehistoire.ch, they would have to have been kept without being lost until today, then digitized and posted. All these steps had to skim the already not very large quantity of photographs of the lakes of the time.
However, there are surely photographs from this period that are still hidden away and perhaps forgotten in Swiss homes, perhaps yours. So you can search and post the images you find on your side. This will allow a larger sample of data from the last century and therefore a richer comparison of all eras.
