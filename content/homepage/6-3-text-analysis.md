Now that we have seen why the users post images on notrehistoire.ch, we can wonder how they tell the story.

We will first try to analyze the text of the descriptions that accompany the photographs. In our case, we will list the 40 common nouns and the 40 most used verbs, and retrieve all the places mentioned as well as the people.

The 40 most used common nouns are part of several lexical fields. First we have everything that relates to lakes directly: for example, two of the three most used nouns are ’water’ and ’lake’. Having kept only the shots representing lakes, this result seems normal: the descriptions effectively describe the subject of which they are the subject.

We can also find lexical fields that come close to lakes secondarily, such as river navigation (’navigation’, ’boat’, ’transport’) with the names of rivers close to lakes (’rhine’, ’rhône’). We see that more than the lake itself, users take into account and describe its environment. Thus, there are also infrastructures of the lake or around the lake (’dam’, ’construction’). Moreover, in the same way that we have analyzed the location and the date of the photographs a lot, the latter are explained by the users since we find the words to describe the altitude (’altitude’, ’meters’, ’m’), location (’region’, ’kilometers’, ’commune’, ’valley’, ’val’) and period (’year’, ’year’, ’centuries’). We can deduce that they want to be precise, which is indeed of great importance in order to have a precise vision of the periods in which the images are registered. And in this case for us, it allows us to have a greater precision in the evolution of the vision and the relationship that the Swiss population maintains with the Swiss mountains lakes.

The places mentioned, for their part, are spread throughout Switzerland and even cross the borders of the
country.

Indeed, many European countries are mentioned (’Italy’, ’Germany’, ’Austria’, ’France’ and ’Spain’) as well as the continent (’Europe’). Switzerland is a country with 5 border countries - the first four countries mentioned are added to Liechtenstein. This is all the more true for lakes since, as indicated by the high occurrence of these two proper names, the Rhine and Rhône rivers which are tributaries of some of them come from these countries. By citing all these foreign places, it reinforces the fact that Switzerland is a country whose history has been mixed over the centuries with the rest of Europe and which is still very close to it. Telling stories about Switzerland but also from elsewhere therefore remains telling Swiss history.
