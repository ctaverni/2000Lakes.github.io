The [2000Lakes project](https://www.idiap.ch/project/2000lakes) project, supported by the UNIL-EPFL CLIMACT Starting Grant program, aims to monitor the progress of the consequences of global warming on the environment through the study of Swiss lakes over 2000m in altitude which are very sensible to it. In addition, the project aims to involve the public in the process so that they take part in scientific research and above all to make them aware of the importance of preserving the Alpine environment. The project therefore has two facets, two different sciences: one scientific and the other citizen.

This data story is part of a bachelor project that focuses on the second. It aims to show how the Swiss population is already involved in the global history of Swiss mountain lakes. In particular, it aims to show the vision that citizens have of climate change through the prism of these lakes. Moreover, by highlighting the fact that they are already involved without knowing it, it could allow them to become involved by searching their own data for information that could be useful for the scientific and historical research of the 2000Lakes project. .
