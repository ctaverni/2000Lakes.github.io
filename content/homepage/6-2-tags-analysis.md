The following analysis required classifying the images according to categories. By giving them keywords, we group them by content in order to analyze the reasons that Internet users have for taking these photos and posting them on notrehistoire.ch.


Browsing through the photographs, a dozen keywords appeared such as Personal’ for photos with family or friends, ’Panoramic’ or even ’Historical information’. Photos that did not have descriptions or one that did not provide information on the reason for the presence of the image were put into two categories: ’Nothing’ for the first and ’Non-informative’ for the second. Photographs can have up to two keywords.

Distribution of pictures among tags

What results is a preponderance of personal and panoramic photos. Therefore, many of the photographs about Swiss mountain lakes posted on notrehistoire.ch were originally taken during excursions, some of them with the family. In addition, the Swiss public have a particular interest in the beauty of landscapes.

The third most important category of photos is 'Dam'. The list of lakes with a dam includes 41, or 18%.

By sharing these pictures, the goal was also to provide information of all kinds. Indeed, by grouping the photographs with a tag ’Information’, ’Historical information’, ’Lake information’ and ’Waterway information’, this forms a set of 48 photos, which is even larger than those with a ’Personal’ tag. For the rest of the chapter, wewill consider all the tags as a single one named ‘General informations’. Swiss citizens thus create the history of the lakes and their environment by participating at their level in the sharing of information.

It is also interesting to consider individually the tags accounting for the most shots.First, we can compare their distribution over time between them and with the full sample.

From these graphs, we can retain several information. First of all, the personal photographs are distributed almost the same way as the complete sample. Only the decade 2010-2019 differs: there is no explosion in the number of images obtained as can be seen on the rest of the graphs relating to the evolution of time, including those on the tags ’Dam’, ’General information’ and ’Panoramic’. Today, the photos that are taken and shared on notrehistoire.ch no longer have the same purpose. Personal photos have other ways of being visible to the entire close circle of Internet users, but also publicly if they wish. Social networks have become more appropriate platforms for sharing content relating to one’s private life. Internet users therefore share today on notrehistoire.ch stories of their ancestors that they consider as being of interest to other people and today making the History of Switzerland.

Lately, it is interesting to compare the macroscopic properties, that is to say the elevation and the area of the concerned lakes. 

Means elevation and area of different collected pictures groups

The respective averages of lakes with a ’Personal’, ’Panoramic’, ’Information’ and ’Dam’ tag are not alike. The first three tags have average altitudes slightly below or around the average for all the photographs collected on notrehistoire.ch. However, this is not the case for ’Dam’. The reason is not only because the lakes having dams are also located at a higher elevation; Swiss citizens posting images about dams therefore focus on very high altitude lakes. We can assume that it is these dams that are less known to the general public and that therefore the intention behind these publications is to inform the rest of the population as well as possible. The shared history and knowledge makes all the sense then. The less information is known, the more important it is to make it available to everyone, but also the more useful it could be within the 2000Lakes project.

Classifying the photographs into categories taught us that the Swiss population had two main reasons for sharing these images and the texts that accompany them. The first is historical: by giving an insight into their life or that of their ancestors, they create a mosaic of individual stories forming the history of Switzerland. The second is informative: by sharing photos and descriptions, they inform the community about specific topics that they consider important.
