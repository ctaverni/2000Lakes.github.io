The notrehistoire.ch website is filled with personal stories and individual information. But brought together and seen as a separate entity, they form a section of the history of Switzerland which complements itself constantly. The Swiss population has various reasons behind the posting of personal photos on this platform, a different intention in each individual, but when we look at it as a single whole, we see that the primary desire is that of information - historical, environmental, localized. For the majority of shared documents, this leads to an impartiality that is nuanced, however, by the privileged relationship that the Swiss public has with the mountains and lakes that are nestled there.

Climate change has visible consequences on the ecosystems of these lakes. By being spectators of these alterations, Swiss citizens become active witnesses. Indeed, initially only reporter of observations, they add more and more contexts and comparisons as well as a feeling felt. This development allows the notrehistoire.ch community to learn from each other and raise awareness through visualization. In order to allow these processes to continue, i.e. that the public wants to share other personal documents that are part of the collective history and through this, that they become aware of the urgency of taking concrete measures to preserve these natural treasures, the goal of this project is primarily to bring together the information present and give them an overview of their own information.

### And you can be part of it. 
### By sharing pictures. 
### By being conscious of the emergency. 
### By making actions. 
### By taking part in the project.
