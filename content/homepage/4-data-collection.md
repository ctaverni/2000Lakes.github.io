The 2000Lakes project already has a database containing the list of 287 lakes over 800 meters above sea level.
For each of these lakes and each decade from 1850 to the present day, we recover a maximum of 10 pictures with the following information:
- about the photo: url, date, place, title and description
- about the lake, subject of the photo: canton, altitude, area.

The number was chosen in order to have a representative sample of images of the overall content of notrehistoire.ch about Swiss Alpine lakes and their history.

The result was the recovery of over 1000 photos from 48 different lakes.

The next step was cleaning the data in order to remove:
- Duplicates;
- photographs not depicting lakes;
- photographs depicting the wrong lake.

At the end of this stage, only 222 photographs remained, spread over 45 different lakes, greatly reducing the sample initially collected.
