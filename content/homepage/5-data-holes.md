Before analyzing the data that we have obtained, we can analyze the absence of those that we have not been able to acquire. This is all the more important and revealing information as these absences are extremely present.

Indeed, of the 42,660 images that we could have collected at most, we only obtained 222, or 0.5%.

First of all, only 45 lakes out of the 237 with an altitude of more than 800 meters are represented by the data collection. The average altitude of the lakes represented by the photos is 1599 m, while that of the 237 lakes is 1945 m. The average surface area is 1.97 km² compared to 0.49 for all altitude lakes. The photos posted on notrehistoire.ch are taken on lakes that are on average larger and less high. This data is what one would expect. Indeed, the larger a lake and the easier it is to access, the more people could know it, take pictures of it and post them.
However, it is important to take into account another data that qualifies this. Only two lakes account for almost 25% of all the photos collected. Lac de Joux with its 1004 m altitude and 8.8 km² surface confirms the general impression by being the lake with the most photos (28). But the second most represented lake is the Schwarzsee, or Black Lake, with 26 photos. However, the latter has a small altitude of 1046 m, but also has a small area of 0.45 km².
It can be assumed that this is due to the characteristic of the photos taken. In the case of Lac de Joux, Schwarzsee and the lakes with the most photographs, the subjects are varied as will be seen during the analysis by tags. Of a family, informative, sporting nature, this diversity is opposed to the reasons for taking the other smaller lakes which were photographed most of the time as part of scientific or recreational excursions.
