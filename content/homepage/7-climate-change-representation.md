The main objective of the 2000Lakes project is to follow the evolution of climate change. Over the years, Swiss citizens are increasingly witnessing these consequences and are increasingly comitted in the fight. 

Is this reflected in the images we have retrieved?

A tag not mentioned until there is ‘Weather’. It groups images and their descriptions showing weather at a certain time, and the comparison with other time periods - of the year or not. In 150 years, average temperatures have increased by almost 2°C. This consequently leads to changes in climate and weather. Rainfall is more frequent, especially in winter, while snowfall is less so. They freeze 60% fewer days in Switzerland (since 1961) and heat waves are 200% more frequent (since 1901).

The descriptions of these photographs therefore reflect this change and testify to the public’s awareness through the change in weather.

As we saw earlier, descriptions have a positive trend. But what about descriptions of just these shots?

The results obtained are as follows:
- negative: 0.07835714285714286
- neutral: 0.8852857142857142
- positive: 0.03642857142857143
- compound: -0.22415714285714286.

The positive and negative scores are nearly reversed across all descriptions, and so the ‘compound’ score shows an overall negative sentiment. We can therefore see the emotional involvement of the Swiss population. They notice these rapid changes over time and have a pejorative view of them. They are aware of what is happening.

By highlighting the global trend in which each individual is part, it can allow them to engage even more in a fight against a reality that they already see in a negative way.


More than simply observing a changing climate, some users directly compare these climatic changes but also any change.
The following post from 2015 compares the freezing of Lac de Joux according to the decades, after noting that “On this Sunday February 22, the Lac de Joux is closed to walking and skating because the temperatures are too mild.”. It refers to other posts about Lac de Joux:

The comparison is also made for reasons other than the freezing of the lakes. Constructions can also lead to the same mechanism, as is the case with the rehabilitation of the Illsee dam:

Illsee before rehabilitation in 2009 [See post](https://notrehistoire.ch/entries/RL28Lwd9BKA) | Illsee after rehabilitation in 2013 [See post](https://notrehistoire.ch/entries/P7VW13KABnv)

More than a photo comparison, the Internet user went to look for the reasons for such a construction and found an [article](https://notrehistoire.ch/entries/QqOYOlE0BEZ) on notrehistoire.ch on this subject, which subsequently uses his photos to illustrate it. By communicating and pooling their information, they weave the fabric of the history of this lake.
The use of comparative images is widely used by the media as shock images illustrating global warming.
Here, it is the same mechanism that makes it possible to raise awareness among users of notrehistoire.ch who compares their images with those of others and notices the differences that have appeared over the years. By seeing those due to global warming and by being involved in the awareness-raising process, this makes possible a more pronounced commitment on the part of the Swiss population concerned. This project aims to be a catalyst for this phenomenon by highlighting everyone’s ideas on this subject even more and bringing them together.
