There are already ways for the general public to participate in the creation of history. One of its possibilities is [notrehistoire.ch](https://notrehistoire.ch/). This online platform is dedicated to the preservation and promotion of the collective history of Switzerland. Everyone can share, discover and preserve their stories, memories and testimonies through images, videos, archival documents or write stories to document and illustrate their experiences and memories. The main objective of notrehistoire.ch is to collect and preserve the individual and collective stories that have shaped the country and reflect its diversity and richness.

Since the Swiss Alpine lakes are part of this collective history, many documents have already been shared through this platform. It is therefore a source of a lot of scattered information. The objective is therefore to recover those concerning the Alpine lakes, to group them and to analyze them as a whole. By transmitting them, we restore a summary of what constitutes the life of the Swiss population and the country. In this case, we are particularly looking for the citizens' vision of global warming.

The visualization of the impact of climate change is easier to understand for an audience uninitiated in chemical and biological data, and therefore more impactful for them to get involved in the fight against this warming. Highlighting these consequences through photos, moreover whose origin is shared, can only be beneficial for the implementation of concrete actions for the climate on the part of all.
